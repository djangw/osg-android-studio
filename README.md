An OpenSceneGraph Android Studio project example built with Google's Hello GL2 example and a [guide application](https://github.com/OGStudio/openscenegraph-cross-platform-guide-application) from [Opensource Game Studio](https://github.com/OGStudio).

This project builds everything from the sources including OpenSceneGraph and its dependencies so you can just download this project and start writing your application - Remove the sample code and write your own code.

You'll need NDK, CMake and LLDB in your Android Studio installation.
